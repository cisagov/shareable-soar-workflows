# Sample SOAR Workflows

## Overview
This is a repository of workflows provided for those interested in deploying
Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response capabilities within their
organizations.

The workflows are mapped and organized based on how their core effects align with the
NIST Cybersecurity Framework. For more information on the NIST framework, documentation
is available at the [NIST Website](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework)

In Addition to the main set of workflows, a sample of workflows that were developed for
a pilot on Indicator of Compromise Automation for State, Local, Tribal, and Territorial
governments is also provided as a use case. These samples provide a Use Case to 
illustrate how organizations can tailor these workflows to address their own environments

##  Guide to Workflows

Many of these workflows are designed to work in an integrated environment where one
workflow can call another. To better understand the relationships between workflows,
the following mapping is provided as a guide.

## Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN)

BPMN is a standard for modeling business process that is used for the workflows in this 
repository. It is maintained by the Object Management Group and full documentation is 
available on the 
[BPMN Specification Website](https://www.omg.org/spec/BPMN/2.0/About-BPMN/). The 
workflows in this repository are
provided in the XML format ".bpmn" as well as in PNG form. The XML files can be read 
using a variety of [tools](https://bpmnmatrix.github.io)

To aid the reader in understanding the syntax used in these workflows, the following
abridged guide to BPMN is provided.
